This is a dumb little tool for creating Rust byte-string literals

== Use ==

`bs-literal` acts as a filter:

----
$ echo -n ˙ ͜ʟ˙ | bs-literal
\xcb\x99\xe2\x80\x86\xcd\x9c\xca\x9f\xcb\x99
----

The output can then be copied and pasted into a `b""` literal in Rust code.

Alternatively, you can name a single file as an argument, subject to normal argument-parsing conventions. See `--help` for more.

== Bugs / Future Work / Whatever ==

Any problem unceremoniously panics, resulting in an ugly error message.

There's no option to elide the trailing newline (pipe through `perl -pe chomp` or something).

== But why? ==

I needed some prebaked HTTP requests to test a parser with at one point and slapped version zero together.
